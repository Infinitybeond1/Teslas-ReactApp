      <h3>What they do</h3>
      <p1>
        Self driving cars, AKA Automatically Guided Vehicles, are vehicles
        (which are sometimes battery powered) that can drive themselves. These
        types of vehicles use either Cameras, Radar, Lidar, Sonar, or a
        combination of them. The most popular type of these cars is a tesla.{" "}

      <h3> Teslas </h3>
      <p1>
        Teslas are electric cars that use State of The Art technology to drive
        themselves. They use a proprietary 8 camera setup which provide the car
        with a 360Â° veiw of the car and its surroundings. Tesla models (2020 and
        prior) are also equiped with radar technology, which are more acurate
        than cameras but only up to 10 meters as the radio waves lose
        effectiveness over a long distance.

      <h3>Cameras</h3>
      <p1>The cameras on tesla cars have a max range of 250 meters</p1>
